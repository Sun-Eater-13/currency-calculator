# currency-calculator
Exercise from some website

I did exercise from this link:
https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/currency-exchange
but without point 5, the result is the same as in point 1.

Summary:
This calculator counts how much foreign currency you should get based on your budget and exchange rate.
But then it turns out that exchanging booth have only one type of bill.
The booth takes the rest of the money and will not give you the change.
Then the calculator counts how many bills you will actually get and what is they total worth.
Finally, it counts the maximum amount of money which you can exchange to not lose any of it, but this time it also takes spread into account.
I don't know why spread is taken into account only during the last step, but that is what the authors of the exercise wanted.
